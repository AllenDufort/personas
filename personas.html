    <p>What is a persona???</p>
    <p>Personas are fictional characters created to represent the different user types that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way. They are used as a reference to help guide decisions about product features, navigation, interactions, and even visual design. Personas are created through research, including interviews and surveys, and should be based on real data whenever possible.</p>
    <p>Personas are typically given a name, a photo, and a brief description. They are often created in sets, with each persona representing a different type of user. For example, a website for a clothing store might have personas
      like "Fashionable Fiona," "Budget-Conscious Betty," and "Busy Mom Brenda." Each persona would have different needs, goals, and preferences when shopping online, and the site's design and features would be tailored to meet those needs.</p>
    <p>Personas are a valuable tool for ensuring that a product or site is designed with the user in mind. By creating personas and referring to them throughout the design process, designers can make informed decisions that prioritize the needs of their target audience.</p>
