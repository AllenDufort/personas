    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>
      Do you remember the first time you used a microwave? 
      Personally, I don't, but I do remember the first time I used the new microwave on the 4th floor of the CIT. 
      I was confused and could not figure out how to open it when my food was done heating.
    </p>
    <p>
      This confusion inspired me to figure out if other people had a similar experience and how I could change that. 
      I then decided to observe and survey 3 people to learn about their experiences using the microwave. 
      After collecting the survey results and observations, 
      I created 2 personas to represent different types of users that may interact with the CIT microwave.
      Finally, I created a storyboard to illustrate the end-to-end experience of using the microwave.
    </p>
    <p>
      This entire process helped me understand the needs, 
      wants and feelings of the microwave users and 
      how to change the design to potentially improve user experiece.
    </p>
    <p>Below is a diagram of the microwave that had me stumped.</p>

        The purpose of the microwave is to heat up food. 
        The number pad and special mode buttons determine how long the food cooks in the microwave. 
        The timer on top indicates how much time is left for the food to cook.
