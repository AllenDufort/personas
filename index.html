    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>
      Do you remember the first time you used a microwave? 
      Personally, I don't, but I do remember the first time I used the new microwave on the 4th floor of the CIT. 
      I was confused and could not figure out how to open it when my food was done heating.
    </p>
    <p>
      This confusion inspired me to figure out if other people had a similar experience and how I could change that. 
      I then decided to observe and survey 3 people to learn about their experiences using the microwave. 
      After collecting the survey results and observations, I created 2 personas to represent different types of users may interact with the CIT microwave.
      Finally, I created a storyboard to illustrate the experience of using the microwave from beginning to end.
    </p>
    <p>This entire process helped me understand the needs, wants and feeling of the microwave users and 
      how to change the design to potentially improve user exeperiece.</p>
    <p>Below is a diagram of the microwave that had me stumped.</p>
