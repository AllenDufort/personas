    <h1>Survey Details</h1>
    <p>
      I first surveyed 3 people who were using the microwave in the 4th floor of the CIT. 
      I then collected their responses and observed their interactions with the microwave.
      Here are the results of the survey and observations:

    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All interviewees used the microwave to heat food</li>
      <li>Each interviewee used a different button to set the time to heat food</li>
      <ul>
        <li>One interviewee manually set the cooking time by using the number pad</li>
        <li>A second interviewee pressed “Quick 30” 3 times to cook their food for 1.5 minutes</li>
        <li>A third interviewee pressed the “Popcorn” button to heat up some popcorn</li>
      </ul>
      <li>All interviewees struggled to open the door after heating food due to the child-lock feature</li>
      <ul>
        <li>One interviewee thought they broke the microwave when it wouldn’t open</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Two interviewees mistakenly used the “Timer” instead of “Add Time” button.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>“Add Time” sets the time you want the food to cook, and 
          “Timer” creates a countdown clock that does not activate the microwave.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Survey Results</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>What do you use the microwave for?</b>
        <p><i>Response:</i> All interviewees use the microwave to heat up food.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>How often do you use the microwave?</b>
        <p><i>Response:</i> Two of the interviewees use the microwave multiple times a week. 
          One interviewee uses the microwave a few times a month.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Is the microwave easier or harder to use than other microwaves? Why?</b>
        <p><i>Response:</i> All interviewees reported that the microwave is harder to use than other microwaves because of the autolock feature. 
          They found the microwave unintuitive because you had to press 0 after heating the food to unlock the microwave.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Did you have any trouble with the microwave the first time you used it?</b>
        <p><i>Response:</i> The first time the interviewees used the microwave, they struggled to open the door and had to figure out how to unlock it.
        They also were confused by the “Timer” and “Add Time” buttons.</Time></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Would you change anything about the microwave?</b>
        <p><i>Response:</i> Interviewees said they would remove the autolock feature and make the instructions for unlocking the microwave more obvious.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
