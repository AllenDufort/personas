    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      My main takeaway from this project is that you should always 
      consider the user when designing a product.
      Creating personas and storyboards helped me understand the
      needs, wants and feelings of stakeholders and how to
      change the design to potentially improve user experience.
      Getting feedback from real users also helped me realize
      how much users value a simple and easy-to-use interface.
      My last takeaway is that you should not assume that your product
      is intuitive to users, even if the product is commonly used.
